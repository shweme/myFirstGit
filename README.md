## Week 2

### This week was an introduction to VCS and Github.

### Install instructions:
#### When cloning a git repository from a terminal, you need to run the command git clone <the repository's https url>. **MAKE SURE
#### YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE DIRECTORY YOU WANT THE GITHUB REPO CLONED INTO**
#### Alternatively you can download the repo as a zip file onto your computer.

### Run instructions:
#### In VS Code, open the folder you want your project to be in (remember to perform a cd if you mkdir in terminal)
#### In the terminal, make sure your github repo is cloned/pulled (see install instructions)
#### cd myFirstGit, if you haven't already.
#### Create a file. Eg: hello.js
#### In the file, type in: cosole.log("Hello World!")
#### Hit ctrl+s
#### In ther terminal, enter: node hello.js (or whatever you have named your file)
